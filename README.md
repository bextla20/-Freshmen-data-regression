Predicting and understanding different key outcomes in a studentâ€™s academic trajectory such as grade point average, academic retention, and degree completion would allow targeted intervention programs in higher education. Most of the predictive models developed for those key outcomes have been based on traditional methodological approaches. However, these models assume linear relationships between variables and do not always yield accurate predictive classifications. On the other hand, the use of machine-learning approaches has been very effective in the classification of various educational outcomes, overcoming the limitations of traditional methodological approaches.
